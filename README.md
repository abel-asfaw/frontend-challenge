Prerequisites:

-   Ensure you have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Open a terminal and navigate to the directory of the Vite project:

`cd frontend-engineer-challenge`

### Install Dependencies

If you haven't installed the project dependencies or if you've just cloned the project, run:

`npm install`

Or, if you're using Yarn:

`yarn`

### Start the Development Server

Start the Vite development server:

`npm run dev`

Or with Yarn:

`yarn dev`

Once the server starts, you should see a message indicating the URL you can use to access the app. For this app, it's http://localhost:5173. Open this URL in your web browser.

### Stop the Development Server

To stop the Vite development server, press CTRL + C in the terminal.
